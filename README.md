A case study with a focus on Data Cleaning using various SQL queries. The Dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data).

1-	Standardizing Date Format

2-	Filling NULL values in certain columns

3-	Breaking a string (Addresses) into multiple, easier to read, columns

4-	Removing duplicates 

5-	Deleting unwanted columns

6-	And more!
